# Nerve-of-Steel
MGTC28 - In-class exercise 4

This program makes use of two libraries called "random", and "timer" to create a game called "Nerve of Steel".

In Nerve of Steel, a group of players compete to win by being the last one to sit down a timer runs out. 

The duration of the timer is randomly chosen by the random library, and the parameters are set to between 5-25 seconds. Additionally, a list of 5 players has also been 
created. Once the timer runs out, the program randomly chooses a name from the list of players to be declared the winner.
